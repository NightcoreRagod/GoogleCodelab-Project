Google Code Labs projects are not automatically saved to your GitHub account. You will need to manually copy the project files and upload them to your GitHub repository.
Here are the steps on how to do that:
 * Create a new repository on GitHub.
 * Clone the repository to your local machine.
 * Copy the project files from your Google Code Labs project to the local repository.
 * Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
Here are some additional tips:
 * You can use the git add command to add specific files to your commit.
 * You can use the git commit command to create a new commit with your changes.
 * You can use the git push command to push your changes to your GitHub repository.
Please let me know if you have any otherÂ questions.
